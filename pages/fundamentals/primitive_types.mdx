Primitive types are most commonly declared as literals:

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Literal values"}
  height={400}
  code={literals}
/>

It's also possible to create the built-in types using their constructors -- however, this is relatively uncommon and not idiomatic for common usage.

<EditorConsole 
  title={'Constructor functions'}
  height={400}
  code={primitiveConstructors}
/>

Standard library methods for manipulating primitives are available as methods on the instance:

<EditorConsole 
  title={'Standard library methods'}
  height={400}
  code={primitiveMethods}
/>

There are library methods for casting strings to numbers and vice versa:

<EditorConsole 
  title={'Casting'}
  height={400}
  code={primitiveCasting}
/>
