There are two kinds equality operators:

- `===`: **strict** equality comparison using "triple equals"
- `==`: **loose** equality comparison using "double equals", which first uses _type coercion_ to convert values to the same type, and then compares them

> There's no built-in way to compare values for "structural equality" (e.g. comparing two arrays to see if they contain the same element)

## Strict equality

We should _almost always_ use strict equality comparison with `===`, since the behavior is more consistent.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Strict equality"}
  code={strictEquality}
/>

## Loose equality

Loose equality can be convenient, but is less consistent, so it's best to use `===` instead.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Loose equality"}
  code={looseEquality}
/>

## Structural equality

If we want to compare structural equality, we'll usually turn to a 3rd party library, such as [lodash.isequal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.isequal). However, an _inefficient but convenient_ way is possible using the built-in `JSON.stringify` method.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Structural equality"}
  code={structuralEquality}
