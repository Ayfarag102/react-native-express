There are two kinds equality operators:

- `===`: **strict** equality comparison, which compares _references_
- `==`: **loose** equality comparison, which compares _structure_ using type coercion

## Strict equality

We should _almost always_ use strict equality comparison with `===`, since the behavior is much more predictable.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Strict equality"}
  code={strictEquality}
/>

## Loose equality

Loose equality is convenient, but even more unpredictable, so it's best to use `===` instead where possible.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Loose equality"}
  code={looseEquality}
/>
