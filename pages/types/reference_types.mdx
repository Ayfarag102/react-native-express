import objectType from '../../examples/files/types/objectType.ts'

Everything that isn't a primitive type is a reference type. 

The main differences are: 

- Primitive types are **immutable**, while reference types are **mutable** 
- Primitive types are passed to functions **by value** (a copy of the data), while reference types are passed **by reference** (the original).

There are 2 extremely common built-in reference types: `Array` and `Object`.

## Arrays

We use array literal syntax to declare arrays:

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Arrays"}
  code={arrayType}
/>

## Objects

Objects are associative arrays (a.k.a maps or dictionaries). 

> Objects are used extensively throughout JavaScript, both in the standard library and implementation of OOP (classes, inheritance, etc).

We use object literal syntax to declare objects:

<EditorConsole
  title={"Objects"}
  code={objectType}
/>
