In ES5, classes are just functions, with instance methods assigned to `MyFunction.prototype`. ES6 allows us to use the simpler `class` syntax.

`class` gives us built in instance functions, static functions, and inheritance. `constructor` is a special function that is called automatically every time a class instance is created. We can use the `static` keyword to declare static class functions.

<EditorConsole {...classExample} height={480} />

# Inheritance

The `class` gives us simple inheritance with the keyword `extends`. In classes that inherit from parents, we have access to a function `super()`. Within an inherited function in that child class, `super` will invoke the parent class's version of that function.

<EditorConsole {...extendsExample} height={480} />

For full details on the `class` syntax, see the MDN reference for [class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).
